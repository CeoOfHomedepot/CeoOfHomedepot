# Hi, I'm Daniel Mezini! 🚀

### "Programming is my ultimate form of expression—where imagination has no limitations."

I'm a **Computer Science Freshman at Montclair State University** with a journey that started 5 years ago in the world of Game Dev. From scripting mechanics in Lua to exploring the depths of C++ and AI, I build because I love the freedom of turning "what if" into reality.
